/* this will encompass everything I've learned
so far -
  text with different -
    colors
    sizes
    fonts
    and how to put in fonts "not reconized"
  pix -
    with and without distortion
    re-sizing them
  combination of different items to acheive a sam look
  use of both class and type to achieve the same result, 
  some times with even in the same line
